Contextus is a project that tracks the most popular news stories on the Internet in near real time.

##MediaBytes
MediaBytes is a daily technology email newsletter that I co-author every morning with my father Shelly Palmer.  In addition to a 100-200 word blurb on current events, the email includes the most important stories in technology, media, and entertainment. We use a combination of Interspire IEM and a specialized Contextus deployment to surface the top stories each day. With over 600,000 daily subscribers, the email has become a foundational part of the Shelly Palmer brand.

##Contextus.com
Pleased with the success of MediaBytes, I decided to build a consumer-facing version-- [contextus.com](http://contextus.com). Taking inspiration from Product Hunt, Contextus’s tagline is simply “The most popular stories on the Internet, every day.” It's a lot like the old Digg.com, except that it uses websockets to update in almost real time.

The iOS version will be available at the end of June. 

##Project Echo
Echo is broadcast television news production tool. Built on top of the Contextus API, Echo gives journalists, community managers, and producers a real-time dashboard of the most popular stories on the Internet.
