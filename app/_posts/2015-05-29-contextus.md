Contextus is a project that tracks and ranks the most shared news stories on the Internet in near real time. At any moment, Contextus gives you a macroscopic view of the news cycle. In addition to the public [site](contextus.com), I built a second version for internal use at Landmark/ShellyPalmer. It is used every day to surface the top tech stories for the daily email newsletter, which now boasts more than 600,000 subscribers.
