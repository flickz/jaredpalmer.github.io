On our way to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, my Dad and I stopped in Kitzbuhel, Austria. My older brother Brent, who lives in Hong Kong, also met us there.

Having skied mostly on East Coast most of my life, Kitzbuhel is very different. Everything is very spread out. Curiously, there's terrain for just about everyone. It's a lot like a golf course. On a given trail, they'll be a groomed section (the fairway), an mostly ungroomed section (rough), and then tons of backcountry with knee-deep powder and cliffs (tall grass at St. Andrews) all right next to one another. Brent and I played out of bounds for most of the trip.
