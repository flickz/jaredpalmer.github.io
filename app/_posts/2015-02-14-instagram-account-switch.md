One of the most frustrating things about Instagram is the inability to quickly switch profiles (unlike Twitter). As a founder, proud cat owner, and normal user, I have several accounts. I put together an example using Framer.js of what the interaction might look like.

After posting it to the Framer.js Facebook group, it received a warm response. Everyone seemed to agree that it was a pain point. Koen and Jorn (the creators of Framer) retweeted the video. Koen also brought it to the attention of Joy-Vincent Niemantsverdriet, one of Instagram's Product Designers. Eventually, well...look at your profile. Enough said.
