This is a guide for me and my company. The first part describes our guiding principles and ideals. The second part is a set of problem solving techniques and heuristics, dare I say "framework," that I have developed over the years.

## Ideals

No one is perfect. Striving to be perfect is a wasteful, damaging, and expensive endeavor. What follows are my ideals that I believe to be attainable in day-to-day work.

### Radical Communication

Ray Dalio, the CEO of Bridgewater (the world's largest hedge fund) champions a concept of "Radical Transparency." The goal of this is to root out subjectivity and politics in the workplace. I don't think Radical Transparency is executable or meaningful in all interactions and environments. Instead, I hold that "Radical Communication" is a more realistic approach for my teams.

I played lacrosse in college, and noticed a trend. Good defenses are always talking, even screaming at each other. Defenses win championships. Thus the more effectively you communicate to each other the better you become. The same is true at work. Mistakes tend to be the result of miscommunication. Comms mistakes are always the fault of the manager and not the employee. You, the manager failed to adequately describe or convey what you wanted and expected.

### Radical Enthusiasm

Get involved. There is no excuse for not trying your hardest or giving something 100% effort. Hustle.

More on this later....

## Go Inland and Be Killed

During Operation Neptune, on DDay, American Major Norman Cota was pinned down in Omaha Beach. Days earlier, Cota had advised against a daytime invasion, but the generals did not listen. The Germans were ready for the American's morning ground invasion and were slaughtering the shit out of American infrantry in their machine gun nests. Cota and his men were fucked. Seeing that death inevitable, Cota rallied his troops,

_"Gentlemen, we are being killed on the beaches. Let us go inland, and be killed."_

Aside from perhaps being the most badass thing ever said by a homosapien, this quote is profound on many levels worth exploring.

With regards to problem solving, this is another way of saying 1) "when you don't have a good answer, change the question." 2) sometimes the most optimal solution is seemingly irrational.

This is also a prime example of Sun Tzu "appear strong when you are weak..."

## Punishments must also be paid by those giving the punishment

On my high school football team, captains could give out punishments for missing practice, being late, being disruptive, or not helping with equipment. The "catch," however, was that the captains had to do whatever punishments they gave alongside the transgressors. This meant that punishments were not something taken lightly and when/if you did make a mistake, you knew that your punishment would always fit the crime.

## Errors of Omission

Everyone makes mistakes. Shit happens. Mistakes are learning opportunities. As a team, you should be open and honest about mistakes. Communincating mistakes (and learnings) should be a regular practice and not taboo or awkward. Any negative feedback at all actually hurts the team as it 1) makes people afraid of making mistakes and 2) makes them afraid to share/escalate mistakes when they occur. You, as a leader, want to know about mistakes early and often.

## Errors of Comission

If someone does make a mistake, or sees something wrong, or does something wrong AND then proceeds to try to cover it up, refrain from immediately share/escalate it with their superiors, or _\<insert almost any disingenuinous behavior\>_, this should be considered a fireable offence. Even the smallest, trivial error of comission is completely unacceptable.
