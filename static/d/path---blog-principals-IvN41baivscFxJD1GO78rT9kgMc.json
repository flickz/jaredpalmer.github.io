I don't think Radical Transparency is executable or meaningful in all interactions and environments. Instead, I hold that \"Radical Communication\" is a more realistic approach for my teams.</p>\n<p>I played lacrosse in college, and noticed a trend. Good defenses are always talking, even screaming at each other. Defenses win championships. Thus the more effectively you communicate to each other the better you become. The same is true at work. Mistakes tend to be the result of miscommunication. Comms mistakes are always the fault of the manager and not the employee. You, the manager failed to adequately describe or convey what you wanted and expected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"radical-enthusiasm\"><a href=\"#radical-enthusiasm\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Radical Enthusiasm</h3>\n<p>Get involved.

Days earlier, Cota had advised against a daytime invasion, but the generals did not listen. The Germans were ready for the American's morning ground invasion and were slaughtering the shit out of American infrantry in their machine gun nests. Cota and his men were fucked. Seeing that death inevitable, Cota rallied his troops,</p>\n<p><em>\"Gentlemen, we are being killed on the beaches. Let us go inland, and be killed.\"</em></p>\n<p>Aside from perhaps being the most badass thing ever said by a homosapien, this quote is profound on many levels worth exploring.</p>\n<p>With regards to problem solving, this is another way of saying 1) \"when you don't have a good answer, change the question.\" 2) sometimes the most optimal solution is seemingly irrational.</p>\n<p>This is also a prime example of Sun Tzu \"appear strong when you are weak...\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"punishments-must-also-be-paid-by-those-giving-the-punishment\"><a href=\"#punishments-must-also-be-paid-by-those-giving-the-punishment\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Punishments must also be paid by those giving the punishment</h2>\n<p>On my high school football team, captains could give out punishments for missing practice, being late, being disruptive, missing or not helping with equipment. The catch was that the captains had to do whatever punishments they gave with the transgressors. This meant that punishments were not something taken lightly and when/if you did fuck up, you knew that your punishment would always fit the crime.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Principals","description":"fuck","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"blog-principals","internalComponentName":"ComponentBlogPrincipals","path":"/blog/principals","component":"/Users/jared/workspace/github/palmerhq/web/src/post.tsx","componentChunkName":"component---src-post-tsx","context":{"pathname":"/blog/principals"},"updatedAt":1527896905937,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/jared/workspace/github/palmerhq/web/src/post.tsx","pathname":"/blog/principals"}}
